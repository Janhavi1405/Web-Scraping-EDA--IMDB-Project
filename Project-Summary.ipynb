    "- The data retrieval process consisted of two major components: \n",

    "    2. API integration\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first phase involved web scraping to extract all 500 movie titles from the Letterboxd list. Since the full list is distributed across five paginated views on the website, a loop-based approach was implemented using the `_requests_` and `_BeautifulSoup_` libraries in Python. For each page, movie titles were extracted from structured HTML elements and compiled into a single list. Each title was then cleaned and standardized to support accurate lookup via the OMDb API.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the second phase, the compiled list of titles was used to programmatically query the OMDb API. Each movie title was submitted as a search query, and structured metadata was returned in JSON format. A delay was implemented between API calls to ensure rate limit compliance. The returned records were stored in a tabular format and reviewed for completeness.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To address potential mismatches and incomplete responses, a title correction dictionary was created. This allowed for re-submission of failed queries with revised or corrected movie titles (e.g., adding apostrophes, correcting translations, or adjusting special characters). This additional step significantly improved the match rate with OMDb and ensured a more complete final dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The final retrieval process yielded a well-structured DataFrame containing detailed information for nearly all of the 500 films. All scripts for scraping and API retrieval are available in the corresponding project notebooks, and the entire process was designed for reproducibility and transparency."

    "Our enrichment part of the project focused on deriving new features, standardizing existing ones, and improving the interpretability of key variables.

    "  Some movies failed to return results from the OMDb API due to minor discrepancies (e.g., missing apostrophes, alternate translations, or formatting issues). A title correction dictionary was created to remap these entries to their accurate titles. This allowed for a second round of API queries, significantly improving coverage and reducing data loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Derived Features for Analysis**:  \n",
    "  Post-cleaning, new columns and structures supported multi-dimensional analysis. For example, relationships between runtime and IMDb rating could be assessed, genre distributions explored, and director-based comparisons performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "These enrichment steps collectively ensured that the final dataset was not only complete and standardized, but also analytically robust. It supported descriptive statistics, visual exploration, and interactive filtering with high fidelity which we will explain in subsequent sections."
